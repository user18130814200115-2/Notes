# Notes Spring 2023

This repository exists to host my lecture notes for the courses I am taking this
semester at the University of Oslo.

The notes are taken directly in latex and are "compiled" into pdf's using
`lualatex`. The `.aux`, `.log`, and other associated latex files are not
included as they can be generated from the `.tex` files.

## Included classes
- Philosophy of Language and Logic
    + Philosophy of conditionals
- Climate change and Energy transition: philosophical issues
- Middle English: Phonology and syntax
- Ethics of forgiveness
    + DROPPED
